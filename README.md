# SignalCapturer

## About

SignalCapturer is an Android application that surveys memory consumption patterns in real-world Android devices. This is part of a research project at the NSG Lab at LUMS led by Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi, Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi and Dr. Zahaib Akhtar. The project seeks to develop solutions for improving user experience on mobile devices when memory falls low.
